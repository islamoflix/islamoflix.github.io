                <p class="sub">
                    We might have get the enough basics of the religion of islam as of now. We understood what is islam,
                    which is submission of will to the
                    one and only creator of the heavens and the earth. And we understand that the last prophet of islam
                    is prophet Muhammad sallallaho alayehi wasallam. But who actually is he, who is Muhammad ibn
                    abdullah peace and blessings be upon him?</p>

                <p class="super">
                    This section is not going to be a seerah of prophet as I am not qualified to write any kind of
                    seerah(biography) of prophet. If you want to read his biography, I can suggest a book called sealed
                    nectar. These books are not hundred percent accurate as in order to get the information there are
                    some hadith uses which consists weak ones as well. But I would suggest you to read that book to get
                    a more better understanding of his time and about the prophet himself peace be upon him.</p>

                <p class="head">Now,</p>

                <p class="super">The first and foremost question that some individuals may ask is. What is the actual
                    evidence that the prophet Muhammad peace and blessing be upon him was actually there? Was there even
                    a person in arabia in the 7th century named Muhammad or the whole story is man made?
                </p>

                <p class="superBold">For these questions, we do have arabic records available. The biggest one would be
                    the Qur'an for obvious reason. Apart from it, we have companions of prophet and companions of
                    companions taba'een.</p>

                <p class="sub">
                    But if someone wants a source outside of arabic records. We have roman records of 7th century of
                    wars with muslims by which obviously the leader of them was Muhammad peace be upon him.</p>
                <p class="sub">
                    You can also check the 7th century historian John Fennick who mentioned prophet by name in greek
                    literature.
                    So, this isn't even a question to ask at the first place.</p>


                <p class="superBold">Prophet's tribe:</p>

                <p class="super">Prophet Muhammad peace and blessings be upon him was from the tribe called banu hashim.
                    Which was a sub-tribe of Quraish. Which is one of the most respected and honored tribe of that time.
                    And banu Quraish's lineage goes back to prophet Ismail peace be upon him.</p>

                <p class="sub">Prophet was known to be the most trustworthy person. As the matter of fact. The name of
                    prophet "Muhammad" means praise worthy of honorable.

                    Prophet was a merchant and his wife Khatija may allah be pleased with her was a business woman.
                    khatija radiallahu anha married prophet because of his trustworthy nature and his truthfulness.

                    There are varies in the sources in what was the age of Khatija radiallahu anha got married to
                    prophet which is around 28 - 40. But one thing is clear that she was older then the prophet himself.
                </p>
                <p class="head">
                    The prophet used to go up in a cave on a mountain called ghar-e-hira or cave of hira.
                    One day he went on the cave of hira and all of a sudden, something grabbed him and seized him. And
                    then that entity said, "Iqra" read. The prophet replied I can not read. Again the voice came "Iqra",
                    and prophet said I can not read. And third time the voice came which was actually a verse.</p>

                <p class="headBold">This is surah Al-'Alaq:</p>
                <ul class="verses" id="surah-alaq">
                    <li class="superBold">iqra bissmi rabbiqal lazi khalaq,</li>
                    <li class="superBold">khalaqal insana min 'alaq,</li>
                    <li class="superBold">iqra rabbukal akram,</li>
                    <li class="superBold">al lazi 'allamal bil qalam(pen)</li>
                </ul>
                <hr>
                <ul class="verse" id="english-translation">
                    <li class="superBold">Read, in the Name of your Lord Who createdâ€”</li>
                    <li class="superBold">created humans from a clinging clot.</li>
                    <li class="superBold">Read! And your Lord is the Most Generous,</li>
                    <li class="superBold">Who taught by the pen.</li>
                </ul>

                <p class="super">And he released, and now finally he can take a breath. He looked up at the horizon. He
                    saw an angelic creature. He(prophet) ran away and ran to his home, to his wife and said to her cover
                    me up, cover me up.
                    Then Khatija radiallahu anha calmed him and said that god would never punished him. She started
                    counting him all his good nature to calm him down. Here the sources differ in this part. Khatija
                    radiallahu anha went to his cousin who was a christian and a scholar and she told him about the
                    incident and he told her that this creature was angel gibrail and he warned Khatija that muhammad
                    will going to face tough time and have to face persecution.</p>

                <p class="sub">Long story short, after this incident. Prophet received multiple revelation and people
                    started coming to islam. And among them the first muslims were Khatija, ali ibn abu talib, abu bakr
                    as-siddiq. may allah be pleased with him all. Here I want to highlight bilal radiallahu anh. Who was
                    actually a freed slave. Whome the abu bakr the closest friend of prophet bought on more then double
                    or triple the price of him. And he set him free. Though bilal was already a muslim before he was
                    free but that shows you the brotherness among muslims. And those who accuse islam for slavery. I
                    would highly recommend them learning about bilal may allah be pleased with him.</p>
                
                <p class="super">The pagans of mecca tried to stop him for spreading islam. They offered him power and wealth. But prophet said even if you were to put sun in my one hand and moon on the other, I will not stop preaching the message of Allah. The pagans of mecca persecuted his companions and his people. The prophet saw a complete boycott of him and his followers, economically, socially in every shape of form. To save the people from the boycott and persecution. Prophet ordered their people to migrate abyssinia.</p>
                <p class="sub">The prophet went to Yathrib and preached the islam where he became their leader and the place yathrib is well known as the city of prophet Madina munawwara.
