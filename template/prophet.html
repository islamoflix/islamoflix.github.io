                <p class="sub">
                    We might have get the enough basics of the religion of islam as of now. We understood what is islam, which is submission of will to the
                    one and only creator of the heavens and the earth. And we understand that the last prophet of islam is prophet Muhammad sallallaho alayehi wasallam. But who actually is he, who is Muhammad ibn abdullah peace and blessings be upon him?</p>
                
                <p class="super">
                    This section is not going to be a seerah of prophet as I am not qualified to write any kind of seerah(biography) of prophet. If you want to read his biography, I can suggest a book called sealed nectar. These books are not hundred percent accurate as in order to get the information there are some hadith uses which consists weak ones as well. But I would suggest you to read that book to get a more better understanding of his time and about the prophet himself peace be upon him.</p>
                
                <p class="head">Now,</p>

                <p class="super">The first and foremost question that some individuals may ask is. What is the actual evidence that the prophet Muhammad peace and blessing be upon him was actually there? Was there even a person in arabia in the 7th century named Muhammad or the whole story is man made?
                </p>

                <p class="superBold">For these questions, we do have arabic records available. The biggest  one would be the Qur'an for obvious reason. Apart from it, we have companions of prophet and companions of companions taba'een.</p>

                <p class="sub">
                    But if someone wants a source outside of arabic records. We have roman records of 7th century of wars with muslims by which obviously the leader of them was Muhammad peace be upon him.</p>
                <p class="sub">
                    You can also check the 7th century historian John Fennick who mentioned prophet by name in greek literature.
                    So, this isn't even a question to ask at the first place.</p>
                
                
                <p class="superBold">Prophet's tribe:</p>

                <p class="super">Prophet Muhammad peace and blessings be upon him was from the tribe called banu hashim. Which was a sub-tribe of Quraish. Which is one of the most respected and honored tribe of that time. And banu Quraish's lineage goes back to prophet Ismail peace be upon him.</p>

                <p class="sub">Prophet was known to be the most trustworthy person. As the matter of fact. The name of prophet "Muhammad" means praise worthy of honorable.

                    Prophet was a merchant and his wife Khatija may allah be pleased with her was a business woman. khatija radiallahu anha married prophet because of his trustworthy nature and his truthfulness.
                
                    There are varies in the sources in what was the age of Khatija radiallahu anha got married to prophet which is around 28 - 40. But one thing is clear that she was older then the prophet himself.</p>
